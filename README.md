# Alien Goop Cracking

Factorio mod, allows for a way to automate alien artifacts "collection" that incentivises exploration without much headscratching industry behind it.

## World Spawn

Alien nests will randomly have a *oil-like* **resource sprout** below them.

Using a *pumpjack* on it will allow you to extract **Alien Goop**.

The yield of these camps increase with distance to the spawning-zone, ~~and also depend on map-gen settings *Alien Bases Richness*~~. This, and other values, can be tweaked in the `config.lua` file.

## Recipes

Use a chemical plant to **Congeal Alien Artifacts**, or mix it with fish to get some powered-up **Cotton Candy**. Yummy!

Also has barreling in case you don't also use a [railtanker mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Choumiko/RailTanker) and really want that sweet, sweet pink juice in your base.

## Wish-list

- Using Alien Bases Richness as another factor for a well's yield
- Better graphics (I'm sorry ðŸ˜”)
