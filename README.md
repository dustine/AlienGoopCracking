# Alien Goop Cracking

Factorio mod, allows for a way to automate alien artifacts "collection" that incentivises exploration without much headscratching industry behind it.

## World Spawn

Alien spawners will randomly (low flat chance, in the config.json) have a *oil-like* **resource sprout**. 

Using a *pumpjack* on it will allow you to extract **Alien Extract**. 

The yield of these camps increase with distance to the spawning-zone, and also depend on map-gen settings *Alien Bases Richness*.

## Recipes

Use a chemical plant to **Congeal Alien Artifacts**, or mix it with fish to get some powered-up **Cotton Candy**. Yummy!

Also has barreling in case you don't also use the Railtanker mod and really want that sweet, sweet pink juice in your base.
