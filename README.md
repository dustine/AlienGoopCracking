# Alien Goop Cracking

Factorio mod, allows for a way to automate alien artifacts "collection" that incentivises exploration without much headscratching industry behind it.

## World Spawn

Alien nests will randomly have a *oil-like* **resource sprout** below them.

Using a *pumpjack* on it will allow you to extract **Alien Goop**.

The yield of these camps increase with distance to the spawning-zone. This, and other values, can be tweaked in the `config.lua` file.

Sometimes these fields will spawn with reduced viscosity (one fifth than regular) and be much easier to tap into. They're white **Boosted Alien goop wells**.

There's also rumours that if a biter spawner is destroyed over an existing goop well, it may boost it...

## Recipes

Use a chemical plant and stone to **Congeal Alien Artifacts**, or mix it with fish to get some powered-up **Cotton Candy**. Yummy!

Also has barreling in case you don't also use a [railtanker mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Choumiko/RailTanker) and really want that sweet, sweet pink juice in your base.

**New**: Bob/Angels mod support!
- If `bobenemies` is installed, it's possible to (expensivelly) craft the new artifacts with coal, goop, sulfuric acid and some congealed artifacts.
- If `angelsbioprocessing` is installed, you can convert alien goop (not goo!) into alien bacteria, without having to use any perchloric acid.
